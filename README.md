# 🦠 Cancer Data Classification (Logistic Regression)
## 📑 Project Summary
In this project, I have used logistic regression to classify the cancers we have as benign or malignant.       
No machine learning libraries were used in this project pytorch sckitlearn etc.

## ⚙️ Data information
My data consists of 569 cancer cells and 30 characteristics of each cell.

## 📈 Plot of Cost and Number of Iterations
We examine how much or how little error the model we obtained with the graphical design of the cost and Number of Iterations ratios makes. As can be seen here, the margin of error of the model is very, very low.

### 🧾 General note
The values used in the project, such as lerning_rate and num_iterations, were determined according to the accuracy and graph type of the results.
