# Logistic_Regression_Cancer_Data
In this project, I have used logistic regression to classify the cancers we have as benign or malignant.
my data consists of 569 cancer cells and 30 characteristics of each cell.
The values used in the project, such as lerning_rate and num_iterations, were determined according to the accuracy and graph type of the results.
